# css-challenges

A place to code your code-pens but in your fav editor.

## adding a new challenge

- create a new folder with your challenge name and an `index.js` file which will be the entry file
- update the config.js file with key as the next available number and value with the exact `folder-name`

## running it

- npm run dev -- -c <key-number-added-above>

> For example `yarn dev -c 1` will start `Challenge 1` at http://localhost:1234
